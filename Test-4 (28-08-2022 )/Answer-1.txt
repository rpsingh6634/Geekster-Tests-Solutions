Question 1--Is react a framework or a library and what is the difference between the two?

Answer-- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.


Library--
         A Library is a set of code that was previously written by a developer that you can call when you are building your project.In Library, you import or call specific methods that you need for your project.
In simple words, a bunch of code packed together that can be used repeatedly is known as Library.
Reusability is one of the main reasons to use libraries.



FrameWork--
            A framework is a supporting structure that gives shape to your code.

In the Framework, you have to fill the structure accordingly with your code.
There is a specific structure for a particular framework that you have to follow, and it's generally more restrictive than Library.
One thing to remember here is that frameworks sometimes get quite large, so they may also use the Library.
But the Framework doesn't necessarily have to use Library.
