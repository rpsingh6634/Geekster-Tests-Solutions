        What are components in react?

Answer--1

          Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

A Component is considered as the core building blocks of a React application. It makes the task of building UIs much easier. Each component exists in the same space, but they work independently from one another and merge all in a parent component, which will be the final UI of your application.

Every React component have their own structure, methods as well as APIs. They can be reusable as per your need. For better understanding, consider the entire UI as a tree. Here, the root is the starting component, and each of the other pieces becomes branches, which are further divided into sub-branches.



In ReactJS,mainly two types of components.

1--Functional Components
2--Class Components
