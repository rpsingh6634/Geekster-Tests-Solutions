       What are props in react?

Answer--2
          Props stand for "Properties." They are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments. Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.
         
Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. Inside the components, we can add attributes called props. These attributes are available in the component as this.props and can be used to render dynamic data in our render method.

Example--

import React, { Component } from 'react';  
class App extends React.Component {  
   render() {     
      return (  
          <div>  
            <h1> Welcome to { this.props.name } </h1>    
            <p> <h4> Javatpoint is one of the best Java training institute in Noida, Delhi, Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Faridabad. </h4> </p>          
          </div>  
      );  
   }  
}  
export default App;
